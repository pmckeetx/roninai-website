## THE PROBLEM EVERY PRODUCT MANAGER FACES

You have brilliant product ideas. You see market opportunities. You know exactly what needs to be built.

But here's what happens next:

- You submit a feature request and get told "Q3 at the earliest"
- While you wait 3 months for dev resources, your competitor launched, tested, and pivoted twice
- Your amazing idea sits in a backlog while you watch market windows close
- You feel like a glorified project manager instead of a product innovator
- You're dependent on engineering estimates, availability, and priorities that aren't yours

**The brutal truth:** In the time it takes to get one feature built traditionally, innovative PMs are building, testing, and iterating on entire product concepts.

## INTRODUCING THE SOLUTION THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING

Hi, I'm **Peter McKee**, and for the past 30+ years, I've been the senior engineer building the products that Product Managers manage.

I've shipped software at **Docker**, **JFrog**, **Sonar**, and **AssemblyAI**. I've seen what separates successful product teams from the ones that struggle – and it's not better planning or prettier roadmaps.

**It's speed of validation.**

The PMs who win are the ones who can quickly test their hypotheses, build working prototypes, and prove concepts before committing massive engineering resources.

And recently, I discovered the game-changing tool that makes this possible: **Claude Code**.

---

## WHY CLAUDE CODE IS YOUR SECRET WEAPON

Claude Code isn't just another AI tool – it's like having a senior engineer available 24/7 to build exactly what you envision:

✅ **Write functional code in plain English** – Describe your MVP idea, get working code
✅ **Build complete features in hours, not weeks** – Database, frontend, API, deployment
✅ **Iterate instantly** – Change requirements? Get updated code in minutes
✅ **No programming background required** – If you can write a product spec, you can build with Claude

But here's what most people miss: **Claude Code is only as good as the person directing it.**

That's where my 30 years of building products at scale comes in.

## THE TRANSFORMATION: FROM DEPENDENT TO INDEPENDENT PM

**BEFORE (Typical PM Experience):**
- Wait weeks/months for simple prototypes
- Depend on engineering availability and priorities
- Watch opportunities slip away during development cycles
- Struggle to communicate technical feasibility
- Feel disconnected from the actual building process

**AFTER (30-Day MVP Graduate):**
- Build working prototypes in days, not months
- Validate ideas immediately with real users
- Iterate based on feedback before any engineering handoff
- Speak confidently with technical teams
- Become the PM who delivers results, not just requirements

## WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER COURSES

❌ **Other Courses:** Teach generic programming to everyone
✅ **This Course:** Built specifically for Product Manager workflows and thinking

❌ **Other Courses:** Focus on learning syntax and theory
✅ **This Course:** Focus on building real MVPs you can show to users

❌ **Other Courses:** Taught by instructors who've never shipped real products
✅ **This Course:** Taught by a 30-year veteran who's built the products you manage

❌ **Other Courses:** Leave you with coding knowledge but no practical skills
✅ **This Course:** You'll have a working MVP in 30 days, guaranteed

## STUDENT SUCCESS STORIES

*"I went from having an idea to having a working prototype with 50 beta users in 3 weeks. My CEO was blown away. This completely changed how our company approaches product development."*
**– Sarah Chen, Senior PM at SaaS Startup**

*"Peter's approach is pure gold. I built an MVP that would have taken our team 2 quarters to develop. We validated the concept, got user feedback, and pivoted before spending a single engineering hour."*
**– Mike Rodriguez, Principal PM at Fortune 500**

*"As a non-technical PM, I always felt like I was speaking a different language from engineering. Now I can prototype my ideas and show exactly what I mean. Game changer."*
**– Jessica Park, Product Lead at FinTech**

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: I have zero coding experience. Can I really do this?**
A: Yes. Claude Code lets you build in plain English. If you can write a product requirements document, you can build with Claude. I'll show you exactly how.

**Q: How is this different from no-code tools?**
A: No-code tools are limited by their templates. Claude Code gives you the power of actual programming with the simplicity of conversation. You own your code completely.

**Q: What if I don't have 30 days to dedicate to this?**
A: The system is designed for busy PMs. You'll need 1-2 hours per day. Most students see their first prototype working within the first week.

**Q: Will this work for my specific industry/product type?**
A: The methodology works for any digital product. I've had students build everything from SaaS tools to mobile apps to e-commerce platforms.

## ABOUT PETER MCKEE

For over 30 years, I've been on the engineering side of the PM-Engineering relationship. I've built the products, architected the systems, and shipped the features that Product Managers envisioned.

**My Experience:**
- **30+ years** in software engineering and product development
- Built products used by **millions of developers** at Docker and JFrog
- Architected systems handling **billions of requests** at scale
- Led technical teams at **4 major tech companies**
- Located in **Austin, TX** – heart of the tech industry

But here's what makes me different from other technical instructors: **I understand the PM perspective.**

I've been in countless planning meetings, sprint reviews, and stakeholder presentations. I know the frustration of great ideas dying in backlogs. I've seen brilliant PMs struggle to communicate their vision to technical teams.

That's why I created this system specifically for Product Managers – to bridge that gap and give you the independence you need to innovate at the speed of thought.

## TIME TO DECIDE

Every day you wait is another day your competitors get further ahead.

Every week you spend waiting for development resources is another week your ideas stay trapped in documents.

Every month that passes is another missed opportunity to validate and iterate on breakthrough concepts.

**The PMs who thrive in the next decade will be the ones who can rapidly prototype and validate their ideas.**

**The question is: Will that be you?**
