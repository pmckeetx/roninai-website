# Stop Building Prototypes. Start Building Your Company.

## Build a production-ready MVP in 30 days using Claude Code and 30 years of engineering judgment.

You have the vision. You have the market insight. But until now, you have been stuck between two bad options: spending $20,000 on an agency that might not deliver, or trying to stitch together "fragile" code from AI prompts that you do not fully understand.

Most AI-generated applications are digital houses of cards. They look fine on the surface, but they lack the security, structure, and scalability required to handle real users.

**It is time to stop playing with tools and start thinking like an engineer.**

### The "AI Shortcut" is a Technical Debt Trap

The internet is full of "AI gurus" promising you can build a SaaS in an afternoon. They are not telling you the truth.

When you use AI without a professional framework, you inevitably run into these three walls:

1. **The Security Gap:** Your "working" app has no real authentication or leaves your database exposed to the public.
2. **The Spaghetti Code Mess:** After three weeks of building, your app becomes so complex that the AI starts breaking old features while trying to add new ones.
3. **The Trust Deficit:** You are afraid to put your product in front of real customers because you know, deep down, it is held together by luck and bad logic.

You do not need to learn how to write every line of code. You do need to learn the high-level architecture and decision-making frameworks that professional engineers use to stay out of trouble.

### The Promise: A Production-Ready MVP

This course is not about "learning to code." It is about **Engineering Leverage.**

I will show you how to use Claude Code to build an application that is not just a demo, but a professional foundation. By the end of this 30-day program, you will have:

* **A Secure Core:** Implementation of professional-grade authentication and authorization.
* **A Real Database:** A properly structured data layer that grows with your business.
* **Clean Architecture:** A codebase that is organized so well that a professional developer could take it over tomorrow without laughing.
* **Error Handling:** An application that fails gracefully and tells you exactly what went wrong through proper logging.
* **Founder Confidence:** The technical judgment to know exactly what your AI is building and why.

### Why Learn From a Senior Engineer?

The world does not need more prompt engineers. It needs more founders who understand software.

**Instructor: Peter McKee**

I have spent over 30 years in the trenches of software engineering. I have helped build the tools that developers use every day at companies like **Docker, JFrog, Sonar, and AssemblyAI.**

I have seen every way a software project can fail. I am not here to show you a shortcut. I am here to show you the right way to build. I am bringing three decades of "what not to do" to the modern era of AI-assisted development.

I will teach you how to treat Claude Code like a senior developer sitting next to you, rather than a magic wand that produces mystery code.

### Is This Course for You?

**This is for you if:**

* You are a Product Manager, Founder, or "Idea Person" with a specific application in mind.
* You are tired of no-code tools that "hit a wall" when you need a custom feature.
* You want to build on nights and weekends without hiring a $150/hour freelancer.
* You value security and professional standards over "hacks" and "tricks."

**This is NOT for you if:**

* You are looking for a "get rich quick" scheme using AI wrappers.
* You want to build a simple landing page (this is for complex, functional applications).
* You are unwilling to learn the fundamental concepts of how software actually works.

### Build With Confidence. Not Just Code.

Stop wondering if your application is secure. Stop worrying if your code is a mess. Use the leverage of AI combined with the wisdom of a veteran engineer to build a product you can be proud of.
