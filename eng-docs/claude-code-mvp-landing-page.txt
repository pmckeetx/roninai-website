[PROBLEM SECTION - AGITATION]

**IF YOU'RE A PRODUCT MANAGER, THIS PROBABLY SOUNDS FAMILIAR...**

You have a brilliant product idea that could change everything. You can see it clearly - the user flows, the key features, the market opportunity. You've done the research, validated the concept with customers, and you KNOW this could work.

But then reality hits...

❌ Engineering says it will take 6-9 months to build (if you can get it prioritized)
❌ The budget request gets stuck in approval hell  
❌ By the time you get resources, the market opportunity has shifted
❌ You're forced to describe your vision in PowerPoints instead of showing a working prototype
❌ Competitors beat you to market while you're still waiting for dev cycles

**The painful truth:** As a Product Manager, you're often the visionary who can't execute the vision. You're dependent on others to bring your ideas to life - and that dependency is killing your speed, your credibility, and your career growth.

What if there was a better way?

[SOLUTION SECTION]

**INTRODUCING THE CLAUDE CODE MVP METHOD**

**Finally - A Way for Product Managers to Build Working MVPs in 30 Days**

Imagine walking into your next stakeholder meeting with a live, working prototype instead of another slide deck. Imagine validating your ideas with real users in weeks, not months. Imagine having the independence to move at the speed of your thinking.

That's exactly what the Claude Code MVP Method delivers.

**This isn't about becoming a programmer.** This is about becoming an unstoppable Product Manager who can turn ideas into reality using the most powerful AI coding assistant ever created.

[CREDIBILITY SECTION]

**WHO AM I TO TEACH YOU THIS?**

Hi, I'm **Peter McKee** - and I've been building software products for over 30 years.

I've worked as a senior engineer at companies you know and trust:
• **Docker** - Where I helped build tools that transformed how developers ship software
• **JFrog** - Contributing to DevOps solutions used by millions of developers worldwide  
• **Sonar** - Working on code quality tools that power enterprise development
• **AssemblyAI** - Building cutting-edge AI solutions for speech recognition

**Here's what 30+ years in the trenches taught me:** The biggest bottleneck in product development isn't technology - it's the communication gap between business vision and technical execution.

I've watched brilliant Product Managers get frustrated because they had to translate their vision through multiple layers before seeing it come to life. I've seen game-changing ideas die in backlogs while teams worked on "more important" features.

**That's why I created this course.** To give Product Managers the superpower I wish they'd always had - the ability to build their own MVPs and validate ideas at the speed of thought.
