# Peter McKee - Press Mentions & Quotes

## Articles Where Quoted

### Forbes
**How We'll Be Interacting With AI As It Takes On More Work**
- URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2024/02/28/how-well-be-interacting-with-ai-as-it-takes-on-more-work/
- Author: Joe McKendrick
- Date: February 28, 2024
- Quote: Peter McKee, head of developer relations at Sonar, refers to this as an "under-the-covers knowledge foundation." This means "that applications will start or are already using AI technology to augment or totally replace knowledgebases," he says. "Even though AI has been around for a long time, this is different, and although the technology and access to it is a bit limited today, I believe this is something we will see changing in the very near future."

### InfoWorld
**10 Ways Generative AI Will Transform Software Development**
- URL: https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336089/10-ways-generative-ai-will-transform-software-development.html
- Date: January 2025
- Quotes:
  - "As developers adopt AI for productivity benefits, there's a required responsibility to gut-check what it produces."
  - "If developers don't implement automation to scan and monitor AI-generated code, it means exponentially more code to fix and more tech debt."

**12 Principles for Improving DevSecOps**
- URL: https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337453/12-principles-for-improving-devsecops.html
- Date: September 2025
- Quotes:
  - "Embracing a shift-left approach, developers often prioritize unit testing to ensure features and functionality work correctly. However, relying solely on unit testing may leave gaps in quality assurance, allowing bugs to slip through unnoticed."
  - "To bolster QA efforts, developers should integrate static code analysis into their workflow. Automated static analysis examines the internal structure of an application, complementing unit testing by uncovering additional issues."

### Techzine Global
**Programming Past the Pitfalls with AI-Generated Code**
- URL: https://www.techzine.eu/blogs/applications/121222/sonar-developer-lead-programming-past-the-pitfalls-with-ai-generated-code/
- Quotes:
  - "While emerging tools, like generative AI and copilots, hope to provide relief by allegedly freeing up as much as 20-30% of developers' time (according to McKinsey), we're just not at a place yet where we can fully rely on what it produces at face value."
  - "Gen-AI coding assistants are good at suggesting code, but not at stepping back and reflecting on the code and reasoning over its effectiveness."
  - "Right now, generative AI can be more of a stumbling block. It's just not at a place where developers can trust the quality of its output without cross-checking it."
  - "Developers should be able to rely on AI for volume but have the right checks in place to enable the code to be accurate and secure."
